# Supabase Configuration for Guided Gains
# These environment variables are used by the Vite frontend application
#
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Copy this file and rename it to .env (in the same directory)
# 2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase credentials
# 3. Get your credentials from: https://app.supabase.com/project/YOUR_PROJECT/settings/api
#
# IMPORTANT: NEVER commit the .env file with real values to Git (it's in .gitignore)
# For production deployments, add these variables to your hosting platform's environment settings

# Supabase Project URL
# Example: https://xyzcompany.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here

# Supabase Anonymous/Public Key (safe to use in frontend)
# This is your "anon" or "public" API key - it's safe to expose in client-side code
# Example: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here

# Note: SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is NOT needed in frontend
# Service role key is only used in Edge Functions and is automatically provided by Supabase
# NEVER expose service role keys in frontend code!
