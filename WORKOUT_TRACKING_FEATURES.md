# Workout Tracking Features

## Overview
The app now includes complete workout completion tracking with database persistence. Stats start at **0** and increment as you complete workouts.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Dashboard Stats (Start at 0)**
- **Weekly Progress**: Shows 0/[goal] initially, updates as workouts are completed this week
- **Total Workouts**: Shows 0 initially, increments with each completed workout
- Real-time loading states while fetching data
- Automatic refresh when returning to dashboard

### 2. **Workout Completion Modal**
After generating a workout, click "Mark as Complete" to:
- Log total workout time
- Record exercise details for each exercise:
  - **Strength exercises**: Sets, reps, and weight used (lbs/kg)
  - **Cardio exercises**: Duration in minutes
  - **All exercises**: Optional notes per exercise
- Add overall workout notes
- Submit to Supabase database

### 3. **Exercise Logging Fields**
The modal automatically shows relevant fields based on exercise type:
- **Sets & Reps**: For exercises with set/rep structure
- **Weight**: For strength training (not shown for cardio/flexibility)
- **Duration**: For timed exercises like running, cycling, planks
- **Notes**: Optional field for each exercise to track how it felt

### 4. **Data Persistence**
All workout data is stored in Supabase with:
- `workout_completions` table: Stores overall workout info
- `exercise_logs` table: Stores individual exercise details
- Row Level Security (RLS): Users can only see their own data
- Automatic timestamps for tracking workout history
